		<p>I love touring around Chiand Mai. Having the opportunity to visit beautiful places which are not common to other foreigners greatly motivates me. I’m going to write about uncommon places I visited for the first time and loved the experience. </p>

		<p>So, first, Rice Life Café. It is an elegant café which is situated outside the city, and was my favorite place for work for many months. You literally feel like you are in the middle of nowhere, relaxed in a strategic position next to a rice field so you actually can see how people work in the field while you have your great cup of coffee. The place is very silent and peaceful. They have competent and hospitable staff and had marked my preferences. Moreover, they have good taste in music. I lastly listened to the following: https://youtu.be/wWerBScNRpw?t=5m30s. </p>
		<p>Their prices are relatively low, with a cup of coffee costing around 60-100 thb, and a delicious ice cream scoop for just 30 thb. Although I am not coffee maniac and I cannot say about the quality, but I enjoyed it. The coffee and the environment looks great, all-clean and stylish. You have the freedom to walk around and enjoy rice field, elephant statues, fountain and traditional thai-style buildings. In one of the buildings next to the cafe I noticed some events going on. I guess they have facilities for events and meetings. </p>
