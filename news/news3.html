		<p>Today is the 100th day of my everyday drawing challenge. Well, to be honest, I skipped a day. It was after a surgery, I was on a train traveling back home, falling asleep, when suddenly I realized that I hadn't yet draw anything that day. Unfortunately there were no materials close at hand for sketching, and I didn't want to wake up the other passengers by digging through my luggage, so sadly, I missed a day. Anyway, today is the 100th day and there’s a lot of things to talk about. </p>
<p>Why do some people need this challenge? </p>
<p>I don’t know about all graphic design programs, but at my University we had about six to eight hours of drawing per week. We usually drew difficult paintings on huge papers, rarely drawing sketches or imagined creations. So, after University I found that I could draw a big still life, or someone’s realistic portrait, but I was getting really confused when I needed to draw something from my head or to draw a fast sketch. I didn’t do anything about it, and a couple years later found that even huge watercolor still lifes were something I couldn't draw anymore. Almost everything was forgotten. So I wanted to refresh my knowledge about drawing, and keep practicing to not forget the rest. To overcome fear of pen and paper, learn how to draw stuff from my imagination, get in a good habit of drawing, and just draw something that later I can show to friends. One day, while travelling to Ireland, my friend invited me to a sketching masterclass. It was four hours of really fast and intense drawing. After that class we decided to draw every day, to boost our drawing skills. It lasted for a month, and then we gave up. Once more, a few months later I tried, and since then I've never stopped. There are so many ways to give up and just a few to keep motivated. Here’s three tips that can help to stay on track: </p>
 
<p>First, share you work. I’ve started to publish my sketches in Snapster room. Even though there’s only 32 readers and just 3-4 views per photo, it really helps when somebody else knows you have to draw something every day. </p>
<p>Second, change styles and sources. At first I wanted to draw something from my life. Like the best thing that happened that day, a place that was visited, or people I met. But it didn’t work out. There’s usually not much time for drawing when something great is happening in life. So then I decided to try and draw just anything. Sometimes an object around me, sometimes an event I visit, sometimes I practice lessons from youtube, or sometimes it might just be a 30-second one-line drawing of an unrealistic creature. </p>
<p>Third, create challenges.To make it more challenging and variated I like to choose what pens or colours I’ll use before I know what I will draw. In general, just try to use as many various techniques and materials as possible, so it never will be a boring routine. </p>
